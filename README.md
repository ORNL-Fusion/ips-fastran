IPS-FASTRAN
===========

IPS-FASTRAN is a set of flexible theory-based integrated modeling workflows for Tokamaks, built upon the High Performance Computing (HPC) Integrated Plasma Simulator (IPS) framework. Typical IPS-FASTRAN workflows include:

- Steady-state scenario modeling self-consistent with the state-of-art models of core transport, edge pedestal, equilibrium, stability, heating, and current drive
- Time-dependent modeling of discharge evolution from current ramp-up to termination towards a high fidelity tokamak pulse design
- Experiment analysis such as power balance, kinetic EFIT, and core transport analysis
- Reactor design
- Generate surrogate models
