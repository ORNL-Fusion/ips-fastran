Introduction
============

IPS-FASTRAN is an integrated modeling platform for a wide range of flexible theory-based integrated modeling workflows for Tokamak, built upon the High Performance Computing (HPC) Integrated Plasma Simulator ([IPS](https://ips-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest)) framework. Typical IPS-FASTRAN workflows include:

- Iterative steady-state scenario modeling self-consistent with the state-of-art models of core transport, edge pedestal, equilibrium, stability, heating, and current drive
- Time-dependent modeling of discharge evolution from current ramp-up to termination towards a high fidelity tokamak pulse design (TokSimulator)
- Coupled Core-Edge Pedestal-SOL modeling (CESOL)
- Experiment analysis such as power balance, kinetic EFIT, and core transport analysis
- Optimization and theory-based reactor design (TokDesigner)
- Develop surrogate models for the integrated modeling components
